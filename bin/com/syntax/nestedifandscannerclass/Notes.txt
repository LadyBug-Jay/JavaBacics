                      NestedIf 
The 4th variation of the If statement is the Nested If           
               Nested if conditions are conditions which are dependent on each other. 
               If outer condition is true, the inner condition is never checked. 
               Inner condition is only checked when outer condition is passed

 nextLine is a special method that can capture spaces and enters as we
 when we use any method like nextInt() or nextBoolean(), nextDouble() and after that if we use
 nextLine() we need to discard that enter by using an extra nextLine() call
