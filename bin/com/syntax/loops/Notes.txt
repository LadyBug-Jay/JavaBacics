Loop regardless of what kind of loop it is, repeats a block of codes based on the true condition until condition becomes false

Importance of loop
      1. We need loops to execute a block of code multiple time 
      2. to eliminate repetitive times
      3. We use loop to avoid code redundancy
      4. Loop saves time

  example if i want to say good morning 5 times i will have to write 5 print statements
  
  System.out.println("Good Morning");
    System.out.println("Good Morning");
      System.out.println("Good Morning");
        System.out.println("Good Morning");
          System.out.println("Good Morning");
          
          To make the above code look cleaner, we use loops
          
          Types of loop
          1. While loop
          2. Do while loop
          3. For loop
          4. Enhanced loop
          
          Loop works with condition. if condition is true, loop will run. if condition if false, loop will not run
